## Motivation

Routine inspections of solar panels are time-consuming, costly, and prone to human error. By using machine learning—especially convolutional neural networks and transfer learning (e.g. VGG16)—this project automates the identification of panel faults, supporting efficient and scalable PV maintenance alike :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Features

- **Image-based Fault Classification**  
  Detects categories like clean, soiled, physically damaged, or electrically damaged panels using image data.

- **CNN with Transfer Learning**  
  Utilizes a fine-tuned pre-trained model (e.g. MobileNet or VGG16) for accurate and resilient classification :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Local Web Interface**  
  Built with Streamlit/PyQt5 for quick interaction—single-image or batch-mode inference included :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **CSV Report Generation**  
  Easily process multiple images and export results.
