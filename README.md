## Features

- **Image-based Fault Classification**  
  Detects categories like clean, soiled, physically damaged, or electrically damaged panels using image data.

- **CNN with Transfer Learning**  
  Utilizes a fine-tuned pre-trained model (e.g. MobileNet or VGG16) for accurate and resilient classification :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

- **Local Web Interface**  
  Built with Streamlit/PyQt5 for quick interaction‚Äîsingle-image or batch-mode inference included :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **CSV Report Generation**  
  Easily process multiple images and export results.
